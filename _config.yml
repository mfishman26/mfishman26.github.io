          - Summer research assistant in Professor Debdeep Jenaâ€™s (Electrical and Computer Engineering department) group as a precursor to my graduate thesis.
          - Computationally modeled electronic properties of 2D materials such as silicene, graphene, and transition metal dichalcogenides.
          - Researched ballistic transistor modeling methods with primary focus on the Landauer approach originally employed by Kenji Natori. Discovered how to employ these methods using 2D materials.
